                    developers approach styling in modern web applications. It
                    was born out of my desire to break away from the stagnation

                    familiar solutions at the expense of true creativity and
                    flexibility. Galadriel CSS empowers developers to create
                    exceptional, distinctive designs while maintaining clean,
