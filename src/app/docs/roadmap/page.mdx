# **Galadriel CSS Development Roadmap**

The journey of **Galadriel CSS** and its accompanying DSL, **Nenyr**, is one of continuous innovation and refinement. As the framework evolves, the focus remains on delivering a robust, feature-rich toolset that empowers developers to manage styles with unparalleled precision and efficiency. Below is a detailed outline of the planned advancements for the framework.

## **Upcoming Enhancements**

### **1. Robust Validation System**

A key priority is the development of a comprehensive validation mechanism for user-defined rules in Nenyr. While the current system provides basic validation, the new validator will thoroughly inspect all user-defined styles, ensuring that only correct rules are processed. This upgrade will enhance the reliability of the framework, minimizing errors and improving the overall developer experience.

### **2. Actors Model Integration**

To replace the current channel-based system used for managing communication between **Galadriel CSS** components, an **Actors Model** will be implemented using the Actix framework. This architecture will enable more efficient, scalable, and maintainable communication, facilitating smoother interactions between various components of the framework.

### **3. Flexible Development Mode**

An option to run Galadriel CSS in development mode without relying on the terminal UI will be introduced. This will provide developers with greater flexibility and adaptability in integrating Galadriel CSS into their workflows, especially for environments where a terminal UI might not be ideal.

### **4. Comprehensive Testing System**

To ensure the framework's integrity and reliability, a robust and detailed testing system will be developed. Moving beyond basic verification tests, this system will encompass a wide range of scenarios to thoroughly validate the framework's performance and functionality, safeguarding it against regressions and inconsistencies.

### **5. Advanced Selectors in Nenyr**

The **Nenyr parser** will be enhanced to support advanced CSS selectors, allowing developers to define styles for components in more complex and nuanced ways. This feature will empower users to create highly specific styles, opening up new possibilities for modular and dynamic design systems.

## **Vision for Galadriel CSS Version 2**

While the immediate focus is on delivering the first stable version of **Galadriel CSS** and **Nenyr**, there are ambitious plans for the framework’s future. Version 2 of Galadriel CSS aims to push the boundaries of what a CSS framework can achieve, positioning itself as the most powerful and versatile tool in the industry. While details of these additional ideas remain under wraps, they promise to elevate Galadriel CSS to a new standard of excellence.
