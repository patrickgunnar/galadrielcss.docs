# Integrating with Next.js and Docusaurus

## Galadriel CSS in Next.js

Integrating **Galadriel CSS** into a **Next.js** project is simple and straightforward. To get started, you just need to modify your `next.config.js` file to include the `GaladrielWebpackClient` plugin.

Here’s how to integrate it:

1. First, install the `@galadrielcss/webpack` package in your project.

```bash
npm install @galadrielcss/webpack
```

2. Then, modify your `next.config.js` to include the plugin as shown below:

```javascript
import GaladrielWebpackClient from "@galadrielcss/webpack";

const nextConfig = {
    /* config options here */
    webpack(config) {
        config.plugins.push(new GaladrielWebpackClient());
        return config;
    },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

Once you’ve added this configuration, **Galadriel CSS** will be integrated into your Next.js project, enabling you to use its powerful styling features within your application.

## Galadriel CSS in Docusaurus

Although I initially planned to use **Docusaurus** for the Galadriel CSS documentation, I chose **Next.js** due to its flexibility. However, integrating **Galadriel CSS** with **Docusaurus** is still quite simple and can be done with just a few steps.

### Steps to Integrate Galadriel CSS with Docusaurus:

1. **Create a Plugin Folder**:

    In your Docusaurus project root, create a folder named `galadrielcss-webpack` (or any name you prefer).

    ```bash
    mkdir galadrielcss-webpack
    ```

2. **Add the Plugin Code**:

    Inside this folder, create a file named `index.js` and add the following code to instantiate the `GaladrielWebpackClient` plugin:

    ```javascript
    import GaladrielWebpackClient from "@galadrielcss/webpack";

    module.exports = function () {
        return {
            name: "galadrielcss-webpack",
            configureWebpack() {
                return {
                    plugins: [new GaladrielWebpackClient()],
                };
            },
        };
    };
    ```

3. **Create the `package.json` File**:

    In the same folder (`galadrielcss-webpack`), create a `package.json` file with minimal configuration as follows:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "galadrielcss-webpack",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "private": true
    }
    ```

4. **Update the Docusaurus Config**:

    Finally, you need to instantiate the plugin in the `docusaurus.config.js` file. Add the following to the `plugins` array:

    ```javascript
    const config = {
        title: "My Site",
        tagline: "Dinosaurs are cool",
        favicon: "img/favicon.ico",

        // Set the production URL of your site here
        url: "https://your-docusaurus-site.example.com",
        baseUrl: "/",

        // GitHub pages deployment config.
        organizationName: "facebook", // Usually your GitHub org/user name
        projectName: "docusaurus", // Usually your repo name

        onBrokenLinks: "throw",
        onBrokenMarkdownLinks: "warn",

        // Instantiate the Docusaurus "galadrielcss-webpack" plugin
        plugins: ["./galadrielcss-webpack"],

        // Other Docusaurus configurations
    };
    ```

With this configuration in place, **Galadriel CSS** will work seamlessly within your Docusaurus site, allowing you to apply styles in your Markdown (MDX) pages using **Nenyr** markups for JSX elements.

By following these simple steps, you can integrate **Galadriel CSS** into both **Next.js** and **Docusaurus**, making it easy to style your application with powerful utility-first CSS features.
