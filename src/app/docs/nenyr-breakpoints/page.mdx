# **Guide to Creating Nenyr Breakpoints**

Nenyr breakpoints are an integral part of the Galadriel CSS framework, enabling developers to create responsive designs with precision and control. This guide provides a detailed explanation of how to define, configure, and use Nenyr breakpoints to achieve responsive layouts tailored to your application's needs. Every concept, method, and implementation is explored to help you fully understand the flexibility and power of this feature.

## **Overview of Nenyr Breakpoints**

In Nenyr, breakpoints are used to define responsive styles that adjust based on the screen size. These breakpoints are declared within the `Central` context using the `Declare Breakpoints({})` method. The responsibility of this method is to create globally recognized responsive rules, which can then be referenced throughout the application.

Breakpoints are defined with specific orientations—either **mobile-first** or **desktop-first**—to align with the overall design strategy of the application. A mobile-first orientation uses `min-width` CSS rules, while a desktop-first orientation employs `max-width` CSS rules. Each orientation provides unique advantages, allowing the user to choose the approach that best suits their design goals.

## **Defining Breakpoints in Nenyr**

Breakpoints are defined using the `Breakpoints({})` method, which accepts an object as its value. This object contains the specific breakpoints and their corresponding screen width values. Breakpoints are further categorized based on the orientation methods `MobileFirst({})` or `DesktopFirst({})`. These methods provide a declarative way to set up responsive thresholds.

### **Key Details for Breakpoint Declaration**

-   **Scope of Declaration**: The `Breakpoints` method must be declared exclusively within the `Central` context. Any additional `Breakpoints` declaration within the same context will overwrite previous definitions.
-   **Naming Rules**: Breakpoint identifiers should:
    -   Use only alphanumeric characters.
    -   Begin with a letter.
    -   Ideally, follow PascalCase for consistency (e.g., `SmallScreen`, `MediumScreen`).
    -   Be meaningful and descriptive to maintain clarity and uniformity.

### **The Importance of Breakpoint Definition Order**

The order in which breakpoints are defined in Nenyr plays a crucial role in ensuring proper style application in the final CSS. When using the `MobileFirst` orientation, breakpoints should be declared starting from the smallest screen sizes and progressing to the largest. Conversely, in the `DesktopFirst` orientation, breakpoints should begin with the largest screens and move down to the smallest. This order directly impacts the sequence in which Galadriel CSS generates the `@media` rules in the output CSS, ensuring that the cascading behavior of CSS functions correctly.

For example, in `MobileFirst`, smaller screens take precedence, so their styles are applied first, with larger screens layering additional styles as the viewport expands. In `DesktopFirst`, larger screens set the baseline, and styles adjust as the viewport decreases. Incorrect ordering can lead to unintended overrides, breaking the expected responsiveness. Adhering to the correct sequence ensures that the generated styles align with the chosen orientation, leveraging CSS's natural cascade to produce predictable and reliable results across all screen sizes.

#### **Example: Mobile-First Orientation**

```nenyr
Construct Central {
    Declare Breakpoints({
        MobileFirst({
            SmallScreen: "640px",
            MediumScreen: "768px",
            LargeScreen: "1024px",
            ExtraLargeScreen: "1280px",
            UltraLargeScreen: "1536px"
        })
    })
}
```

In this example, the breakpoints are defined with `min-width` rules, starting from smaller screen sizes and scaling upwards.

#### **Example: Desktop-First Orientation**

```nenyr
Construct Central {
    Declare Breakpoints({
        DesktopFirst({
            UltraLargeScreen: "1536px",
            ExtraLargeScreen: "1280px",
            LargeScreen: "1024px",
            MediumScreen: "768px",
            SmallScreen: "640px",
        })
    })
}
```

Here, the breakpoints use `max-width` rules, starting from the biggest screen sizes and scaling downwards.

## **How Breakpoints Function**

Breakpoints declared in the `Central` context are used to generate responsive CSS classes. When a breakpoint is referenced in a `PanoramicViewer` within any context, including the Central context, Galadriel CSS verifies its existence in the `Breakpoints` declaration. If the identifier is valid, the framework creates the necessary responsive styles.

### **Error Handling**

If a breakpoint identifier is not found in the `Breakpoints` method of the `Central` context, Galadriel CSS:

-   Logs a warning.
-   Skips the generation of styles for that particular breakpoint.
-   Continues processing other responsive styles that rely on valid identifiers.

This ensures that missing breakpoints do not disrupt the overall style generation.

## **Applying Breakpoints in Nenyr Classes**

To use the declared breakpoints, reference their identifiers within the `PanoramicViewer` method of a `Class`. The `PanoramicViewer` method allows you to define styles specific to the screen sizes represented by the breakpoints.

### **Example Usage**

```nenyr
Construct Module("moduleContextName") {
  Declare Class("className") {
    Stylesheet({
      background: "${secondaryColor}",
      padding: "${redColor}",
      color: "${primaryColor}"
    }),
    PanoramicViewer({
      LargeScreen({
        Stylesheet({
          padding: "${shadowColor}",
          fontSize: "1em"
        }),
        Hover({
          background: "${accColor}",
          boxShadow: "0 6px 12px ${shadowColor}"
        }),
      }),
      ExtraLargeScreen({
        Stylesheet({
          padding: "${successColor}",
          fontSize: "1.1em"
        }),
        After({
          content: "'✨'",
          position: "absolute",
          fontSize: "1.5em"
        })
      })
    })
  }
}
```

In this example:

-   The `LargeScreen` and `ExtraLargeScreen` breakpoints are referenced within the `PanoramicViewer` method.
-   Styles are dynamically adjusted for specific screen sizes.
-   In the `PanoramicViewer` method the definition's order does matter.

## **Guidelines and Best Practices**

1. **Define Breakpoints Once**: Declare all required breakpoints within the `Central` context at the start of the project to maintain consistency.
2. **Use Meaningful Identifiers**: Breakpoint names should clearly describe their purpose, such as `TabletView` or `UltraWideScreen`.
3. **Adopt a Uniform Naming Convention**: Using PascalCase for identifiers helps maintain readability and consistency across the application.
4. **Choose the Right Orientation**: Decide early whether a mobile-first or desktop-first strategy aligns better with the project’s goals.
5. **Keep Styles Modular**: Leverage the `PanoramicViewer` method to group styles by breakpoints for better maintainability.

## **Common Pitfalls and Troubleshooting**

### **Overwriting Breakpoints**

Declaring multiple `Breakpoints` methods in the `Central` context can lead to overwriting. Always ensure there is only one declaration.

### **Missing Breakpoint Identifiers**

If a referenced breakpoint identifier is missing from the `Breakpoints` declaration, Galadriel CSS logs a warning but skips the style generation. Regularly verify the `Breakpoints` declaration for completeness.

### **Inconsistent Naming**

Using inconsistent naming conventions for breakpoint identifiers can lead to confusion and errors. Standardize the naming approach for all breakpoints.
